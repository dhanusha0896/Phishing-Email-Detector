# Phishing-Email-Detector
The Phishing Email Detector is a web-based tool that analyzes email content to identify potential phishing indicators using pattern recognition and contextual heuristics. It highlights suspicious elements such as urgency-based language, mismatched sender domains, suspicious links, and insecure URLs .
📘 Project Overview
The Phishing Email Detector is a web-based tool designed to help users identify potential phishing attempts by analyzing email content. It detects suspicious keywords, domain inconsistencies, and deceptive links to evaluate the likelihood of phishing. This project was developed as part of a cybersecurity learning exercise inspired by the 'Humans as Attack Vectors' TryHackMe module.
✨ Key Features
•	Email Analysis: Scans sender, subject, and content for phishing indicators.
•	Link Inspection: Detects shortened, insecure, or suspicious URLs.
•	Advanced Options: Enables domain spoofing, grammar, and urgency checks.
•	Risk Scoring System: Assigns a phishing risk score with contextual recommendations.
•	Interactive UI: Modern, responsive design built with Tailwind CSS.
🛠️ Tech Stack
•	Frontend: HTML5, JavaScript, Tailwind CSS
•	Logic: Rule-based content analysis and pattern recognition in JavaScript
•	Design: Responsive layout with live interactivity
🚀 How to Use
1. Download or clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file (or the provided HTML file) in your browser.
3. Enter the sender's email, subject, and content of the email you want to analyze.

🎯 Project Aim
This project aims to increase awareness about phishing and social engineering by demonstrating how attackers manipulate human trust. The tool emphasizes the importance of critical thinking and email verification before responding to or interacting with suspicious messages.
📊 Output and Interpretation
After analysis, the tool displays: 
•	Phishing Risk Score – A numeric representation of the overall risk.
•	Identified Red Flags – A list of suspicious indicators found in the email.
•	Technical Analysis – Detailed insight into domain and link behavior.
•	Recommendations – Practical guidance based on detected risk level.
